    "title": "Breaststroke Technique",
    "content": "Breaststroke is a swimming stroke where the swimmer is on their chest and moves their arms in a half-circle motion while kicking with a frog-like kick. It is a slower stroke, making it ideal for distance swimming. Key elements include maintaining proper body position (horizontal and streamlined), breathing at the correct moments, and coordinating the arm and leg movements.",
    "breathing": "In breaststroke, breathe during the arm recovery phase. As your arms sweep back, lift your head slightly out of the water, take a deep breath, and then return your head to the water as your arms move forward.",
